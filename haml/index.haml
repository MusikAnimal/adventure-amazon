              Our trip begins around 6:00 am from your Hotel. Our guide will pick you up, along with other guests on your trip. We will start the trip by driving up the beautiful Andes Mountains. After a quick breakfast in the small town of Hauncarani, we will visit the pre-Inca Archeological site of Ninamarka and the Paucartambo Inca Museum. After we cross the peaks, we will start our decent into the Cloud Forest. This is the entrance to the Amazon Rainforest and will be our first chance to see unique flora and fauna, including monkeys, unique plants, and several bird species. If we are lucky, we might see Peru's national bird, "Cock of the Rock." We will stop for lunch down this legendry road, spotting wildlife all along the way. When we reach the bottom, we will arrive at the "Bamboo Lodge" for the night. Here we will enjoy dinner and have a look around the forest.

              In the morning, we will take a small walk around the lodge to see the local banana trees and crops. Then we will enjoy breakfast before starting our drive towards Atalaya. We will spot many species on the road. We will also stop at a small Wildlife Rescue Center, where several animals have been rescued from the Black Market. When we reach Atalaya, we will get our Rubber Boots and transfer to a motorized canoe. This will take us down the Rio Madre de Dios to the Soga de Oro Lodge where we will be spending the next two nights. We will have lunch and trek around the surrounding rainforest. After dinner, we will offer an optional night hike to see nocturnal animals like snakes, frogs, and insects.
