              Our trip begins around 6:00 am from your Hotel. Our guide will pick you up, along with other guests on your trip. We will start the trip by driving up the beautiful Andes Mountains. After a quick breakfast in the small town of Hauncarani, we will visit the pre-Inca Archeological site of Ninamarka and the Paucartambo Inca Museum. After we cross the peaks, we will start our decent into the Cloud Forest. This is the entrance to the Amazon Rainforest and will be our first chance to see unique flora and fauna, including monkeys, unique plants, and several bird species. If we are lucky, we might see Peru's national bird, "Cock of the Rock." We will stop for lunch down this legendry road, spotting wildlife all along the way. When we reach the bottom, we will arrive at the "Bamboo Lodge" for the night. Here we will enjoy dinner and have a look around the forest.
