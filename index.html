After we cross the peaks, we will start our decent into the Cloud Forest. This is the entrance to the Amazon Rainforest and will be our first chance to see unique flora and fauna, including monkeys, unique plants, and several bird species. If we are lucky, we might see Peru's national bird, "Cock of the Rock." We will stop for lunch down this legendry road, spotting wildlife all along the way. When we reach the bottom, we will arrive at the "Bamboo Lodge" for the night. Here we will enjoy dinner and have a look around the forest.
