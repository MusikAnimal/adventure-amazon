              Manu is one of the most bio-diverse regions in the World. The bio-reserve is almost exclusively accessed through Cusco, Peru. With 15,000 species of plants and over 1000 species of birds, Manu provides you with an experience you can find nowhere else on Earth. Mammals, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fish, and Insects fill the region. On our journey you will travel down the world-famous Manu Road. Every 50 meters of your descent hosts its own unique ecosystem and species. When we reach the river, you will begin your adventure into Amazon Wildlife. If diversity is what you seek, Manu is for you!
